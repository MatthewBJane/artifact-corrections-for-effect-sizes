# Greetings

Welcome to the living open source textbook ***Study Artifacts and Their Corrections***. This book is designed to assist social/clinical/behavioral/cognitive researchers in understanding the nature of study artifacts, their impact on effect sizes, and proper correction methods. Each chapter includes practical examples, R code, and equations for seamlessly implementing these corrections into your own research projects.

#### What are Study Artifacts? {.unnumbered}

In this book, artifacts will be defined broadly as **any source of methodological contamination that induce bias in research findings**. In an ideal world where studies are conducted perfectly, this book would not exist. Hopefully one day, we reach a point where studies contain only small, inconsequential imperfections and this book becomes obsolete, a relic of a darker past. Until that day, artifact corrections can provide a temporary band-aid to *some* methodological flaws.

#### Open and Living Textbook {.unnumbered}

A living textbook is one that continuously updates with new features and is open to changes from others. This book will contain modern methods and cutting-edge techniques for artifact corrections, so in order to keep this book up-to-date it needs to grow as the research grows.
