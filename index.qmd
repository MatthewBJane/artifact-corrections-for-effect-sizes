# Greetings

Welcome to the open source textbook **Correcting Effect Sizes for Statistical Artifacts**. This textbook covers all the essential equations and code needed to correct for biases in our effect size estimates. It will also hopefully provide readers with a deeper understanding, appreciation, and intuition for these seemingly complex formulas. It also covers how to apply these corrections to meta-analysis in order to enhance the precision of our results.

#### What are Statistical Artifacts? {.unnumbered}

I will define statistical artifacts broadly as **any source of contamination that induces bias in research findings**. Specifically within the context of this textbook, the term "research findings" is more narrowly referred to as effect sizes.
