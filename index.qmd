# Greetings

Welcome to the living open source textbook ***Artifact Corrections for Effect Sizes***. This textbook covers all the essential equations and code needed to correct for biases in our effect size estimates. It will also hopefully provide readers with a deeper understanding, appreciation, and intuition for these seemingly complex formulas. It also covers how to apply these corrections to meta-analysis.

#### What are Statistical Artifacts? {.unnumbered}

In this book statistical artifacts will be defined broadly as **any source of contamination that induces bias in research findings**. Artifacts are present in virtually every research study, so it is crucial that we address them.

#### Living Textbook {.unnumbered}

A living textbook is one that constantly updates with new features and is open to changes from others. This book will contain modern methods and cutting-edge techniques for artifact corrections, so in order to keep this book up-to-date it needs to grow as the research grows. New features, such as interactive figures will be added soon

#### Open Science Practices {.unnumbered}

It is important that this book is both open-source and open-access. All the figures, code, and documents are available in a [github repository](https://github.com/MatthewBJane/artifact-corrections-for-effect-sizes/). The current maintainer of the book is [Matthew B.
